# RadialStop-PteraleC-Contact
Analysis of RS-PtC contact and correlations with wing kinematic changes.  This script extracts data collected through high-speed photogrammetry and macrophotography and explores linear relationships between the timing of RS-PtC contact and changes in wing kinematics.  In particular, it suggests that RS-PtC contact may be correlated to changes in timing of the end of the downstroke, and timing of wing supination during the following upstroke.
